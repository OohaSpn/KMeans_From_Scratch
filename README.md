Overview
This project uses three clustering algorithms—K-Means, Bisecting K-Means, and Single-Link Agglomerative Hierarchical Clustering—to analyze a dataset and compare their performance.

Tasks
K-Means Clustering

Run K-Means with 
K=2,3,4,5,6.
Output for each 
K:
Total SSE (Sum of Squared Errors).
For each cluster: SSE, cluster mean, cluster ID, and instance IDs.
Plot Total SSE vs. K and use the elbow method to choose the optimal K.
Justify the selected  K.

Bisecting K-Means Clustering

Implement Bisecting K-Means, bisecting the cluster with the largest SSE at each step.
Use the chosen K and run 3 trials to generate K clusters.
Output:
Total SSE.
For each cluster: SSE, cluster mean, cluster ID, and instance IDs.
Single-Link Agglomerative Clustering

Perform Single-Link hierarchical clustering to build a dendrogram.
Cut the dendrogram at the chosen K level to create K clusters.
Output:
Total SSE.
For each cluster: SSE, cluster ID, and instance IDs.
Display the dendrogram (graphical or textual).
Comparison Analysis

Compare K-Means, Bisecting K-Means, and Single-Link clustering.
Discuss Total SSE, cluster behavior, and algorithm performance.
Explain why each method gives the observed results.
Output
Provide metrics, plots, and a detailed analysis for each algorithm.
